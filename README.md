App name:

URL of the group project repository: 	
https://github.com/pabgarci/miMapa.git

NOTE: The GitHub version of the app it’s a debug version, so if you try the application you won’t be able to see the map because of the API key, because it’s different for each computer you run it in. If you want you can send us the SHA1 of your AndroidStudio and we can add it to our API Key.

Description of miMapa:

	MiMapa is an appliclation which provides the location of the user and allows him/her to save it into a database. While saving the location, the user can give the location a specific name, and add a picture if wanted. When the user is in the main menu of the app, he/she can see the list of the places saved and can select to visualize the details of a certain location by long pressing the name of it. To show the details, another activity starts, with the picture, the name, and the details of the location, such as street, city or country. In this activity the user can also select the option to show this selected location in the map.
Settings: The user can choose whether he wants to save pictures or not when saving a location, if the user disables this feature, he/she will only be asked for the name of the location when ‘save location’ is pressed. 
The user can also change the color theme of the application and the language. He/She can choose the default language of the device or choose between spanish, german, norwegian or english.	

Difficulties encountered while developing the application:

The main difficulty we faced  during the development of the application was on the use of the native camera app on different phones and therefore the difficulties of the internal storage of the pictures taken.
In some phone brands, the native camera app saves the picture in its default folder and with the default name, this way when we wanted to get the picture we had a null pointer exception in the name and folder we were using. This is why our application only works properly with some devices, for example Samsung.
We also encounted some trouble with setting different themes and colors for the app.
Last but not least we came through a lot of obstacles with the use of GitHub. As none of the members of this group had used it before, we had a lot of problems coordinating all of the codes and merging them together, so we had to fix a lot of bugs that were created. As noob users we lost a lot of time trying to fix all the problems that were created by using GitHub.

Potential extensions to the application:

	The app could be extended by adding an option in which the user can rate the location he/she is saving, rating from one to five stars, based on their experience in that visit, as well as adding categories to define the location, such as nature, bars, accomodation, shopping…
It could also be interactive with other users, and see their opinions, and give ideas of interesting places near your current location. The user could save this ideas from other users in a pending places list, adding there the places which might seem interesting to them.
Another interesting feature that could be implemented is a ‘trending’ activity, to inform the user about events going on around him/her.


Discussion of any issues relevant to the application such as: ethical issues, medical issues, impact on society, risks associated with the application, social, business and financial opportunities, applicability to related fields, possible research ideas related to the application. 

	If this application was to be used in the future for social purposes, it would once again begin an ethical issue by letting everyone know which places you visit, when, with how much frequency…
This could be a risk for the user. Although social media users are concerned about this, they still have a frequent use of  these kind of applications.
It could be a business and financial oportunity for the companies to be aware of big events or where big masses of people gather together. With the categories feature it would be useful to orientate the company about the user’s likes and dislikes.
